This project was done using Apache Netbeans IDE21. This is implemented by using JFrame of Java.he javax.swing. JFrame class is a type of container which inherits the java.awt.Frame class. JFrame works like the main window where components like labels, buttons, textfields are added to create a GUI.
I have also used MySQL as database
This project has 4 tables in the database
It has 18 pages in total.
Change your Conn.java file by adding your database details.
Enjoy Coding!!:)
